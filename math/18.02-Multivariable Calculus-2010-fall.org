* [0/101] Unit 1: Vectors and Matrices
This unit covers the basic concepts and language we will use throughout the course. Just like every other topic we cover, we can view vectors and matrices algebraically and geometrically. It is important that you learn both viewpoints and the relationship between them.
** [0/40] Part A: Vectors, Determinants, and Planes
Vectors are basic to this course. We will learn to manipulate them algebraically and geometrically. They will help us simplify the statements of problems and theorems and to find solutions and proofs.

Determinants measure volumes and areas. They will also be important in part B when we use matrices to solve systems of equations.

** [0/42] Part A: Functions of Two Variables, Tangent Approximation and Optimization
https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/2.-partial-derivatives/part-a-functions-of-two-variables-tangent-approximation-and-optimization
We start this unit by learning to visualize functions of several variables using graphs and level curves. Following this we will study partial derivatives. These will be used in the tangent approximation formula, which is one of the keys to multivariable calculus. It ties together the geometric and algebraic sides of the subject and is the higher dimensional analog of the equation for the tangent line found in single variable calculus. We will use it in part B to develop the chain rule.

We will apply our understanding of partial derivatives to solving unconstrained optimization problems. (In part C we will solve constrained optimization problems.)

https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/2.-partial-derivatives/part-b-chain-rule-gradient-and-directional-derivatives
As in single variable calculus, there is a multivariable chain rule. The version with several variables is more complicated and we will use the tangent approximation and total differentials to help understand and organize it.

Also related to the tangent approximation formula is the gradient of a function. The gradient is one of the key concepts in multivariable calculus. It is a vector field, so it allows us to use vector techniques to study functions of several variables. Geometrically, it is perpendicular to the level curves or surfaces and represents the direction of most rapid change of the function. Analytically, it holds all the rate information for the function and can be used to compute the rate of change in any direction.

In this part we will study a new type of optimization problem: that of finding the maximum (or minimum) value of a function w = f(x, y, z) when we are only allowed to consider points (x, y, z) which are constrained to lie on a surface. The technique we will use to solve these problems is called Lagrange multipliers.
